# Java practice

Repository contains eclipse project with various solved java assignments. I created this to help my students with learning java and also to provide an introduction to git(hub).

For now project contains solved assignments for:
* Conditions
* Loops
* Arrays
* Strings

## Instructions

These instructions will help you to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to install stuff below if you wish to run the project.

Java IDE
* This project was made in [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) so please install it.


Java Runtime and Java SDK:

### Running the project

Pressing green button should run the project normally. 

If there is trouble, try:
1. Right click on the project in Package Explorer (left pane)
2. Select option "Run As" -> "Java application"

Class Main contains main method which will be executed when we run the program. In main method we call methods from other classes depending on what we wish to execute. All methods are public (visible everywhere) & static (access goes through class name). For example, if we wish to run assignment 9 from Arrays we would call the method through class name: 
```
ArraysAssignments.assignment9();
```

**Note*** Holding CTRL and clicking on a method name opens the method code.
